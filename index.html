      <h2>About Ada Lovelace</h2>
      <p>
        Ada Lovelace (1815–1852) was an English mathematician best known for her
        work with Charles Babbage on the Analytical Engine, an early
        mechanical general-purpose computer design. She is credited with writing
        the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine, making her
        the world's first computer programmer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her visionary understanding of computing stretched far beyond simple
        calculation. She imagined machines capable of composing music, producing
        graphics, and assisting in scientific research—ideas that foreshadowed
        modern computing.

      <p>
        Despite facing societal barriers as a woman in science, her contributions
        laid foundational concepts for the digital age.
